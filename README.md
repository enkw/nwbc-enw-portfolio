# nwbc-enw-portfolio

## Description

This was designed to be my first attempt at a portfolio for my work during my process of learning to be a full stack developer. Builind this was a challenging and showed me that I have a lot to learn as far as
CSS is concerned, but I had a lot of fun working on it. I'm learning to really enjoy the feeling of when something that didn't make sense to me suddenly clicks.

The links on the navigation bar direct you to their associated sections of the page, and clicking on a picture of my previous work will take you to their github page.
